            <p class="style-text">The NEO (Near-Earth Object) visualization artwork is an interactive and educational representation of asteroids and other objects that come close to Earth's orbit. Its primary purpose is to provide viewers with a captivating way to explore and learn about these asteroids, particularly their orbits and whether they pose a potential hazard to Earth.</p>
            <p class="style-text">This style guide outlines the design decisions made for the Near-Earth Object (NEO) Visualization application. It covers color schemes, layout considerations, font choices, and other key design elements. Each design choice has been made with the goal of enhancing user experience and facilitating clear communication of information.</p>
